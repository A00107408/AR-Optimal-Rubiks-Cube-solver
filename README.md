# AR computer vision application for optimal Rubik's Cube solution in C#.
AR computer vision (OpenCV) application for optimal Rubik's Cube solution in C#.

Quality of User Experience (UX / QoE) study of instruction formats in AR built in Unity targeting the Meta 2 AR headset.

The application uses OpenCV (computer vision) to scan the current state of the Rubik's Cube, then calculates the optimal solution, which is presented to the AR use one step at a time as text instructions.

This is not production quality code. It was developed for use in a controlled test laboratory environment as part of a specific test framework. 

The Rubik's Cube solving algorithm was translated from the Java repo linked below, into C# for use in Unity
